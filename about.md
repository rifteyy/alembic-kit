Hey guys! My name is rifteyy.

I have a passion for everything regarding **malware** and security software.
Some of my current projects in regards to malware: 

- [BATRAT](https://github.com/rifteyy/batrat) - Fast, lightweight remote administration tool coded in Batch and PowerShell. Contains basic RAT functions - keylogging, sending IP address, detect VPN/Tor/Proxy, set persistency, download/upload files and many more.
- [AntivirusGPT](https://github.com/rifteyy/antivirusgpt) - A custom GPT instructions made for advanced malware removal. Knows what tools and software to recommend in regards to the particular case and can read logs from Farbar Recovery Scan Tool (FRST), Sysinternals Autoruns and more.
- [Batch Defender](https://github.com/rifteyy/batch-defender) (In progress) - A real-time and website protection created in PowerShell and Batch. Currently being recreated in C#.
- [Scheduled Task Scan](https://github.com/rifteyy/scheduled-task-scan) - Advanced tool coded in Batch to scan scheduled tasks. Has the ability to upload files on VirusTotal and get their verdict, can heuristically identify downloader/script malware and display invalid/non-existent entries.
