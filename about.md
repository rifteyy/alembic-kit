Hey guys! I come by the nickname rifteyy.

I am 18 years old cybersecurity student and I live in Czech Republic. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ My dream one day is to become a malware analyst or SOC analyst.

I started working with computers in my early years, because my father used to be a system administrator in a couple of companies. While my father taught me basics about using a computer, it was through self-learning that I discovered and pursued my true passion and that is cybersecurity.

In 2016, I discovered a website that I always keep returning to - [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com). VT is a online file sandbox known for it's static file analysis done by many trusted anti-malware software vendors, such as BitDefender, Sophos, ESET, Avast and more. From here, my interest grew even further and I started reading forums about malware removal. The forum was [Viry.cz](https://forum.viry.cz/) - almost equivalent to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/), but in the Czech language. It fascinated me that the admins always knew what to do, what to delete and recommend. I read over 3000 of these posts and learned to use the malware removal tools - such as [FRST](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/farbar-recovery-scan-tool/) (previously RSIT and HijackThis)

So far, I had the opportunity to help people on subreddits [r/antivirus](https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/) and [r/computerviruses](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerviruses/) to clear their malware and learn something new. The community there is great, I enjoy helping people and I also believe that I am great at it. I started creating educational content on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rifteyy) where I showcase and analyze malware or test various anti-malware software against various threats.

Some of my current projects in regards to malware: 

- [BATRAT](https://github.com/rifteyy/batrat) - Fast, lightweight remote administration tool coded in Batch and PowerShell. Contains basic RAT functions - keylogging, sending IP address, detect VPN/Tor/Proxy, set persistency, download/upload files and many more.
- [AntivirusGPT](https://github.com/rifteyy/antivirusgpt) - A custom GPT instructions made for advanced malware removal. Knows what tools and software to recommend in regards to the particular case and can read logs from Farbar Recovery Scan Tool (FRST), Sysinternals Autoruns and more.
- [Batch Defender](https://github.com/rifteyy/batch-defender) (In progress) - A real-time and website protection created in PowerShell and Batch. Currently being recreated in C#.
- [Scheduled Task Scan](https://github.com/rifteyy/scheduled-task-scan) - Advanced tool coded in Batch to scan scheduled tasks. Has the ability to upload files on VirusTotal and get their verdict, can heuristically identify downloader/script malware and display invalid/non-existent entries.
